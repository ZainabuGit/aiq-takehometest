## Sync Data

* After uploading, click "ðŸ”„ Sync from S3"
* This will trigger backend to process uploaded file into your memory

---

## Visualizer

* Choose a state (e.g., TX, CA)
* Set number of top plants
* Click **Fetch Data**
* Table updates with top N plants based on Net Generation (MWh)

---

## Features

* Secure JWT-based login
* Protected API endpoints
* Upload CSV to AWS S3
* Responsive & clean UI with Tailwind
* Swagger docs for API testing

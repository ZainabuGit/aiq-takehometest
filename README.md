#  AIQ Power Plant Visualizer

A full-stack web application for visualizing power plant data by state, with authentication, file upload to S3, and real-time data sync.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS
* **Backend**: NestJS (Node.js + TypeScript)
* **Authentication**: JWT (Bearer Token)
* **Storage**: AWS S3 (for file uploads)

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
https://github.com/ZainabuGit/aiq-takehometest
cd aiq-takehometest
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontendtw
npm install
```

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

---

## Environment Variables

### Backend `.env` file

```
PORT=8000
JWT_SECRET=secretKey

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=your-region
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket
```

---

## Run the App

###  Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run start
```

Open Swagger: [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api)

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## Authentication

### Login

* Default credentials:

```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

* Use `/auth/login` to receive a JWT token.
* Frontend stores the token and uses it for all secure routes.

---

## Upload CSV to S3

* Navigate to home page
* Upload a `.csv` file via "Upload Power Plant Data" section
* File is sent to: `POST /upload/uploadtoS3`
* Backend handles upload to AWS S3

---

## Sync Data

* After uploading, click "ðŸ”„ Sync from S3"
* This will trigger backend to process uploaded file into your memory

---

## Visualizer

* Choose a state (e.g., TX, CA)
* Set number of top plants
* Click **Fetch Data**
* Table updates with top N plants based on Net Generation (MWh)

---

## Features

* Secure JWT-based login
* Protected API endpoints
* Upload CSV to AWS S3
* Responsive & clean UI with Tailwind
* Swagger docs for API testing

---

## Testing

Use Swagger UI to test:

* `POST /auth/login`
* `POST /upload/uploadtoS3`
* `GET /powerplants?state=TX&top=5`

---

## Folder Structure

```

## Future Enhancements

* Currently if there is more than one record available in the CSV with same name no logic handled there in future we have to define a recruitment and add validation over there

* JWT-based Authentication - Done one hard coded user this needs to be moved to DB level in future

* Support for multiple CSV uploads can be done one by one but the recruitment has to be defined for repeated power plants names can be different files and how we handled this.

* Deploy to AWS (S3 + EC2 or ECS) - this needs to be done and prod and dev env configurations needs to be separated along with separate S3 buckets 
* Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) , this is done but not fully tested for a limited time. This needs to be completed in the future

* Add DB (PostgreSQL or DynamoDB)
* Integration tests need to be completed.
